Code used in final implementation of 16 channel Phased Array Antenna. Work is a collab directly with Jake Kirschner and Justin Jayne. Also help from Dan Rosen. <br/>
SoapySDR is API used to communicate to SDRs. Numpy and Scipy for the majority of the Signal Processing. <br/>
clocksync syncs all of the SDRs clock signals to a gps location clock (important for data synchronization). <br/>
CalibrationFuncs contains all of the functions used to calibrate signals from each channel, including the use of a Nuttal Filter, the OverlapAndSave data for real time processing, Delay Finding using signal correlation, Fractional Delay using a critically sampled sinc function, and Phase Delay using an SVD of the data. <br/> 
Final runs the actual Phased Array Antenna, including setting up each SDR correctly, changing the modes from all actively listening to new data to all listening to calibration signal transmitted from a single one, signal aligning (both in phase and down to a fraction of a sample) using functions from CalibrationFuncs, and then plotting the Complex Data.
